# **LEONARDO - CAD FILES**



This folder contains the master assembly file for the LEONARDO mod kit, it is available in 2 different formats:

​			**.f3z**

​			**.step**

The LEONARDO mod kit was developed in **Fusion 360**, if this is your native CAD program I recommend downloading the **.f3z** format of the master assembly. This will provide you with the master assembly and all of the individual linked sub-assemblies. The .f3z file also contains captured design history of each part, for ease of personal modification. 

If you are **not** a **Fusion 360** user, you can still download the neutral format of the master assembly (**.step**). This variant, however, exists as single standalone assembly and does not contain any of the captured design history.
